## Introduction
For the uninitiated, ICS 414, or "Software Engineering II" is very similar to ICS 314, but is centered around 1 main project that each group works on for most of the semester. 314 was difficult at times, but I loved how it challenged me to be a better developer overall, which is partly why I chose to take 414 the following semsester. Our goal from the start was to make a Meteor-based application for financial projections, using calculations already provided by our customer.     

## First Weeks
I was initially very confused about what the customer specifically wanted, and so were my teammates. Many of us had to read through the customer-provided documents and spreadsheets several times over just to get a decent grasp on the project goals and scope. It was admittedly very stressful trying to highlight what we needed so teammates could be assigned tasks. But the application needed a backend that could store all of our financial data and run the needed calculations.
