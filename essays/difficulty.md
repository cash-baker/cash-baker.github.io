*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

Software engineering, to me, has always conjured up a mix of emotions. I've always been fascinated with computers. However, it's been a field that I have always felt imtimidated by. I felt like an imposter, constantly comparing myself to other classmates, more seasoned developers that applied themselves. So why didn't I give up? 

## Born into it

I always knew I wanted a career involved in computers and software. My father loved tech and made a living selling Nokia cell phone assessories at the swap meet, and he passed down to me his love for tech. Even in the third grade, I knew I wanted to be a game designer 
(although at 8 years old I admittedly had no idea what game designers even did). The underlying passion was always there, but for a while I didn't know a single programming language until I enrolled at LCC. Once I started learning my first languge and others after, I became hooked on the process. I fell in love with the simple process of seeing a problem and figuring out how to solve for a solution, trying to optimize it further. Maybe it's the same reason I adore puzzles, in my head programming was like a series of puzzles that could be solved in your own personalized way. I was (and still am) inexperienced, but the challenge appealed to me. The times where I'd be working on a program for days and it'd finally compile in the exact way you wanted it to were hugely gratifying, to say the least.

## What the future holds

As the years go on, it always seems like the limits keep being pushed of what software can do. The developments being made in fields like AI, cyrptocurrency, cybersecurity, and quantum computing just to name a few, it was all so fascinating to me. I think another reason why I wanted a career in software engineering was because I wanted to be part of that world, perhaps even contribute to it. But I still lack much of any experience, which is what I hope to address in the future going forward. I never joined robotics or even any clubs for that matter, so I'm hoping to get more involved in extracirruclar activites that would enable me to meet more people and less afraid to come out of my shell. I also wanna work on my process for learning new concepts in general. Often I'd be studying a new language and I'd mindlessly spit out the solution, without taking the time to ask myself if I understand something enough or if I should simply spend more time on it. It's one thing to learn about a new concept, but actually internalizing it is something entirely different and makes life incredibly easier. 

## You are your worst enemy 

This really needs a seperate section to emphasize its importance, but the one skill I want to continue developing is being able to NOT compare myself to other people. Software engineering is a huge field with incredibly talented and clever folks, it can be easy to fall into the trap of putting yourself down because you know someone younger than you who can write a program faster or work more efficently. It goes without saying: the only person you should ever compare yourself to is your past self. It doesn't do any good to beat yourself up over mistakes or issues you may run into, and can be more detrimental than helpful.
