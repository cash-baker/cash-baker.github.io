## Introducing Bootstrap 5!
<div class="text-center p-2">

I really had no previous experience with UI Frameworks prior to this week, and I wish I had! Going from Javascript and jumping into Bootstrap 5 is as polarizing as learning a new programming language. You have to shift your entire approach and tackle it in different ways, I found. You can spend hours literally wondering why your img isn't centered and it WILL drive you insane. With Javascript, at least, I ususally understood why my code was wrong. In Bootstrap 5, however, I'd run into situations where I'd feel like my webpage should look a certain way but simply refuses to cooperate. Of course, I'd always remedy the problem, but it was still frustrating nonetheless.
