## Initial Thoughts on Javascript 
Previously, after going through the personal struggles I endured learning Java for the first time, I was told Javascript would be a breeze in comparison, more intuitive, easier to work with overall. This formed the basis of my expectations for JS. Finally, after going through the Javascript courses via freecodecamp, I'm pleased with how pleasant working with Javascript is. Prior to this, I only had experience writing in Java and C, which was very cumbersome to work with, however some of my frustration could be attributed to my inexperience with programming when first learning Java. Overall, I think Javascript is a good programming language due to its simplicity, it feels very user-friendly so far. 

## Thoughts on the learning style
The approach of using WODs to practice Javascript fluency is admittedly challenging, at first. The first practice WOD we did in class was stressful, mostly due to having to work with another person. However, I'm enjoying them. It keeps me on my feet and keeps me from even entertaining the idea of slacking off on classwork. It's still too early to say if I'll continue enjoying the challenge or progressively get overwhelmed. As of right now though, this style of learning has been very digestible for me, and doesn't expect too much or too little from me. Lastly, I also think being able to attend class in-person helps put me in a "zone" that makes it harder for me to be confused or fall behind the curriculum.

## "...16 GB of RAM"
Inarguably the most stressful road bump so far was finding out my laptop met all the requirements needed for class except memory. The lowly 8 GB my laptop had, in conjunction with it having no expandable memory, meant that I suddenly needed to buy a new laptop. I believe the laptop requirements were accessible online prior to the start of the semester, so I'm not pointing blame at anyone besides myself. However, if I had to attribute one singular aspect of the class that got in the way of being able to just focus on learning Javascript, it would be that.  

## Concluding Thoughts
I'm very pleased with the class so far. The practice WODs have been helpful and the pacing of the class isn't too overwhelming. Most importantly, I don't feel alienated in the class, as someone who possesses less than ideal coding experience. I'm looking forward to seeing how much I'll eat my words in the coming weeks!
