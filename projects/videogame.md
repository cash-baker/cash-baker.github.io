A close friend of mine mentioned to me that he was learning Unity and wanted to create a playable demo. The game was a first person action game, made to be a proof of concept of what we both could do in the Unity engine.

My friend spearheaded the project and I was initially brought in to produce songs for the demo. In addition, I provided feedback regarding specific game mechanics and in-game events, such as movement speed of the player and when to trigger music. While the scope of the project was relatively small, it was still an enriching experience, for me personally. I had to coordinate with my friend over internet calls and learned the limitations/advantages that came with working exclusively over Skype. When making music for the project, I had to figure out how to specifically talor the song to complement the mood of the level my friend was designing. For example, the demo ends in a chase which requires the player to run quickly to a specified point in the level. I would run through the chase sequence without music, then decide on song tempo and style that would complement the sequence and also satisfy the artistic style my friend was trying to achieve.

It was my first time seeing a video game developed in real time. It gave me a better sense of how developers/engineers work with artists. Sometimes a developer wants to convey certain feelings through a musical piece with specific qualities but can struggle trying to communicate exactly what they want, so I had to learn how to ask specific questions to better narrow down what they were asking for out of my music piece. Lastly, it taught me how hard software development was and how much coordination is involved, even for something as small as creating a 3 minute video game demo.
