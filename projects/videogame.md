A close friend of mine mentioned to me that he was learning Unity and wanted to create a playable demo. The game was a first person action game, made to be a proof of concept of what we both could do in the Unity engine.

My friend spearheaded the project and I was initially brought in to produce songs for the demo. In addition, I provided feedback regarding specific game mechanics and in-game events. While the scope of the project was relatively small, it was still an enriching experience, for me personally. I had to coordinate with my friend over internet calls and learned the limitations/advantages that came with working exclusively over Skype. It was my first time seeing a video game developed in real time. It gave me a better sense of how developers/engineers work with artists. Lastly, it taught me how hard software development was and how much coordination is involved, even for something as small as creating a 3 minute video game demo.
